The target of this branch is to consolidate the functionality of the four files into one.
To this end, we need to do a few things:
1. Check for overlap between files - 
	determine what needs to be taken from each file and what is already in all
2. Examine memory usage.  We don't necessarily need all the data to be stored in memory for each func.
-> i.e.: we may be able to remove BF from memory once nodes are authenticated.
	-> I'll belay this for now.  We may want to keep it in the event that a node is hotswapped.
3. Merge/Create new files and then test.
	-> I think we can make flags stored in EEPROM to show whether the PUF has already been generated.
	-> At least for testing purposes, that can reduce wear on EEPROM and simplify the control flow of the programs.
